# Requirements:
- JDK 8
- Maven 3.2.3 + 
- IDE with Maven plugin, and you need to know how to use it ;)

# Instructions:

- Fork this repository (with the fork button, you need to be signed in github.com): http://github.com/salaboy/drools-game-engine/
- clone your forked repository: git clone http://github.com/<your user>/drools-game-engine/
- cd drools-game-engine/
- mvn clean install -DskipTests (if you run it with tests it will fail on purpose, the rules are missing, you need to write them)
